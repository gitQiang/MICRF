# MICRF
The MICRF (mutation integration of Conditional Random Fields) model based on R and Matlab.

Matlab code is mainly based on UGM toolbox to train the best parameters for each biological networks.
R code is mainly based on CRF R package to infer and decode the risk labels for each genes.

Simulated data are running for TADA  firstly.

coexp.R: building the co-expression networks from BrainSpan microarray data.

Idea: see report Qiang_3_24.pptx. The integrated data can find more risk genes than the sum of the single data set.


7_6 and 3_17 report slide for old version model details.
